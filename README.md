Colgate Events Calendar Enhancement

Overview:
This project is a redesign and enhancement of the existing Colgate University Events Calendar. 
Our goal is to present events in a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive interface 
that allows for intuitive filtering, searching, and navigation of campus happenings.

Key Features:
- Clean and modern user interface with event category filtering
- Keyword search for fast event discovery
- Responsive event cards with built-in social media sharing options
- Individual event detail pages with descriptions, “Add to Calendar” button, and comment section

Tech Stack:
- Next.js (App Router) — React framework for building the frontend and routing
- Tailwind CSS — Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- React Icons — For social sharing icons
- Local JSON / API structure — Used for simulating dynamic event data
- Deployed with Vercel (recommended) or local development using `npm run dev`

Future Improvements:
- Integration with Colgate’s Localist-powered event RSS feed or API
- Persistent comment system (e.g., using a backend or Firebase)
- Google Calendar / Outlook calendar export links
- Admin dashboard to add and manage events
